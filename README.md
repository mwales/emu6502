# emu6502

Had fun creating a [chip 8 emulator](https://github.com/mwales/chip8).  Going to try to create a
6502 emulator as a stepping stone towards creating 32-bit ARM emulator.

# 6502 Based Systems

* Apple IIe - I wonder if I still have a floppy disk around here of my 8th and 9th grade Apple IIe
  projects I made in computer class.  The apple II was pretty cool because it was pretty easy to
  use the graphical modes from within BASIC.
* Atari 2600 - Wizards worked on this thing.   David Crane (creator of Pitfall and A Boy and his
  Blob did a [fantastic talk (GDC 2011 Pitfall Classic Postmortem with David Crane)
  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBT1OK6VAIU) about nature of programming one of the consoles
  that started home video game revolution.
* Atari 800 Family - My older brothers first computer.  One of my first Christmas memories was when
  Santa Claus brought him a floppy drive.  I was too young at the time to understand the importance
  of the floppy drive vs tape drive.  Many memories playing Decathalon, M.U.L.E., and Racing
  Destruction Set.  My first programming was done here using Pilot.
* Commodore 64 Family - My first computer!!!  I wanted a NES, but parents were having none of this
  game machine crap in our home.  I wrote so many horrible BASIC programs on this.  I only had a 
  B/W TV connected to it for years, so never programmed using any colors.  My SID broke after a few
  years.  But I learned about Sprites and Disk I/O from reading the [Commodore 64: Users's Guide
  ](http://www.commodore.ca/commodore-manuals/commodore-64-users-guide/), and wore out my 1541
  reading and writing my sprite data to floppy disk.  I didn't even know that a sister manual
  existed, OMG!!: [Commodore 64: Programmer's Reference Guide
  ](http://www.commodore.ca/commodore-manuals/commodore-64-users-guide/)
* Famicom / Nintendo Entertainment System - Legendary start for Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Metroid, 
  Final Fantasy, and countless others.  I never owned one until recently.
